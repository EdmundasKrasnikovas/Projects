At Vinted, we manage around 2,700 active Partner accounts who frequently rotate, join, or leave. About 550 of these accounts actively use Slack for BAU procedures.

Previously, Slack access was handled manually â€” my team had to go into each channel and individually add users. In  collaboration with IT, now we are able to provision access automatically, but it still requires us to provide an email and channel names.

Originally, we asked our partners to tell us which channels they need to be in, but it did not seem that secure, and might be confusing for new account owners. As our stakeholders are the ones who own and oversee these processes.

Initialy I've solved this with Google sheets. But then decided to rebuild it in Python for a more efficient, automated, and scalable solution.
